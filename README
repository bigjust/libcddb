WHAT IS LIBCDDB

Libcddb is a library that implements the different protocols (CDDBP,
HTTP, SMTP) to access data on a CDDB server (http://freedb.org).  It
tries to be as cross-platform as possible.  The initial libary will
have a C API.


DOCUMENTATION

The API documentation can be consulted on the project homepage:
    http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/

It is possible to create your own copy of this documentation in both
HTML and LaTeX format using the doxygen program (http://doxygen.org).
If you have doxygen installed, execute the following command in the
doc/ directory:
    doxygen doxygen.conf

This will create two subdirectories html/ and latex/ in which you will
find the documentation in the respective formats.


COMPILING

See INSTALL for instructions.
